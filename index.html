  <b>Welcome to my first-ever web site!</b>
  <b>Over the course of this semester, I have learned an immense amount of information on coding. From inline semantics to embedding media content, this course has taught me very much. However, there is always
    more to learn and more to improve upon. I started school as a business major at the University of Kentucky and I couldn't be more glad to have changed to ICT.</b>
